#The following characteristics are "protected" by United States federal anti-discrimination law:
#race, religion, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
pregnancy, familial status, disability status, veteran status, genetic information
#With our list of terms to denote protected groups, we wanted to reflect these characteristics.
#A very few of the above characteristics were not considered in our list --
#for example: "national origin" since we felt that an arbitrary expression to denote a national origin ("British", "Chinese" etc.) would be too ambiguous
#(these expressions do not too often denote protected groups).
